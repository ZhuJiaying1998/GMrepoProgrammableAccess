[**GMrepo**](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home) is a curated database of consistently annotated human gut metagenomes.
Its main features include:
* extensive manual curation of meta-data of gut samples/runs,
* grouping samples/runs according to their associated human phenotypes (i.e. health and diseases),
* graphical selectors enabling easy and efficient access to all our collected data.

[**GMrepo**](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home) is freely accessible at: https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home.

In addition to the online database, [**GMrepo**](https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home) also provides programmable access to most of the database contents through RESTful APIs. Below please find example codes for a few languages that we use in our lab; users who are using other languages can either create their own codes following these examples, or contact us for support.

* [R](programmable-access/R.md)
* [Perl](programmable-access/perl.md)
* [Python](programmable-access/python.md)
